# Background Removal Tool

A simple graphical user interface (GUI) application for removing backgrounds from images. This tool allows you to select an image file (in PNG, JPG, or JPEG format), process it to remove its background, and save the resulting image. It's built using Python, the Kivy framework for the GUI, and the `rembg` library for background removal.

## Features
- Easy-to-use GUI for selecting images
- Supports PNG, JPG, and JPEG image formats
- Automatically removes the background from the image
- Saves the processed image as `output.png`
- Displays status messages to the user (e.g., success or error)
